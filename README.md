# Snake-game-OpenGL-
The project was made using OpenGL (open graphics library)using c++. The concept in here is as the snake moves, it feeds upon the dot (food) appearing at random places on plane, thereby adding the dot to the length of snake resulting in the increase in the length of snake. Instead of running into the appeared dot if the snake runs into itself or the crosses out of window, the player loses the game. The variant is available with the menu driven themes, for changing the background colors along with automatically changing snake speed as the player goes on to score a certain number of points.
